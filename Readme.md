# Project Name: World Bank International Debt Data Analysis

## Description
This project involves analyzing international debt data collected by the World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various debt indicators. The goal is to find answers to the following questions:

1. What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
2. Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what is the amount?
3. What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
4. How many distinct countries are present in the dataset?
5. What are the distinct debt indicators present in the dataset?

## Data Source
The data is sourced from the World Bank's international debt database.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- PostgreSQL database

## Files
1. `international_debt.sql`: SQL script containing the queries and analyses performed on the international debt dataset.

## Instructions
To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Import the dataset into a PostgreSQL database.
2. Execute the queries provided in the `international_debt.sql` script.

Please refer to the script for detailed SQL queries and their results.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into the international debt data, including the total debt amount, country with the maximum debt, average debt across different indicators, and distinct countries and debt indicators present in the dataset.

For further details, refer to the `international_debt.sql` script.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to analyze and gain insights from international debt data using SQL and the PostgreSQL database. The findings can be used to understand the debt landscape of developing countries and inform decision-making processes.
